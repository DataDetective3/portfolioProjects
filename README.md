# Cyclistic-Case-Study

## **Introduction**

#### For the capstone project, I am assuming the role of a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

To answer key business questions, I followed the six steps of the data analysis process taught in the course which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

- Detailed documentation of SQL code is available in GitHub.
- Initial analysis of datasets provided by Cyclistic using Microsoft Excel.
- Data cleaning, manipulation and exploration using Microsoft SQL.
- Data Visualization using Tableau Public.
- Provides data-driven recommendations based on the analysed data.
